	 * Recommended. This method is called when the parent class can't find a method
	 * specifically build for a given column. Generally, it's recommended to include
	 * one method for each column you want to render, keeping your package class
	 * neat and organized. For example, if the class needs to process a column
	 * named 'title', it would first see if a method named $this->column_title() 
	 * exists - if it does, that method will be used. If it doesn't, this one will
	 * be used. Generally, you should try to use custom column methods as much as 
	 * possible.

	 * Since we have defined a column_title() method later on, this method doesn't
	 * need to concern itself with any column with a name of 'title'. Instead, it
	 * needs to handle everything else.
