== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. A new menu item "Pipes" created right after Posts on the admin sidebar.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there any limitation when using the WP Pipes plugin? =

NO, there is no limitation when using WP Pipes plugin. It's GNU/GPL, you can download & use it for free forever.

= What is a Pipe? =

Let's imagine it as a pipeline of data from one place (Source) to another place (Destination).
One Pipe will start with a Source.
On the way of each Pipe, it can pass over some or many Processors to transform its format to suit the Destination.
At the end, it will stop at a Destination.

= What is a WP Pipes Source? =

Pipe Source is where your Pipe begins. It can be: Posts, Pages, WooCommerce Products, RSS Feeds, Files/Folders,... the sky is unlimited :)

= What is a WP Pipes Destination? =

Pipe Destination is the end of your Pipes. It can be: RSS Feeds, Google XML Sitemap, Files/Folders, WooCommerce Products, Posts,... once again, the sky is unlimited :)

= What is a WP Pipes Processor? =

Pipe Processor is for doing some processes to get more fields for the Destination Input.
Pipe Processor will process some input fields (depends on Processor) and provide some output fields. After that, you can use those output fields for the Destination Input.
