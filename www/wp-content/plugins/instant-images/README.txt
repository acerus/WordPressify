= I'm getting an unauthorized error message during the resize process, is there a fix? =
If your site is using password protection you may need to disable the http authorization as there appears to be an issue with the `media_sideload_image` function in WP core.

No, once an image has be uploaded and resized the raw download will be removed from your server.


= Are there server requirements? =
Yes, this plugin is required to write temporary images into an `/instant-images` directory within your WordPress `uploads` directory for image processing prior to being uploaded to the media library.
